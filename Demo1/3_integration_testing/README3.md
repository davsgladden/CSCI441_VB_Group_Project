# Integration Tests

ALL TESTS ARE LOCATED WITH THE CODE DIRECTORY IN ../1_code/

## Running tests
To run the tests, all project dependencies and setup must be completed first. 
Once the project directory is set up, and the application is started,
proceed to the localhost site in your browser using one of the following links 
for the specific tests to run:

- localhost:8000/apiTest.php
- localhost:8000/orderTest.php

This will run and print the unit and integration test results for the api functionality
or the sell and buy order functionality.

### Test Code Location

The code for the Tests is located in the 1_code directory and is named the following:
- apiTest.php
- orderTest.php
